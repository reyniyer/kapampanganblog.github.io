            <p class="desc">Dating back its origin, during the start of the rains, as the town folks would start planting rice; children would set out for the rice fields, streams and estuaries fed by the Rio Grande de Pampanga. This signaled the start of the frog-catching and rainy season eventually became a frog-catching season. Catching frogs was relatively easy. With fishing rod and string, the children jiggled a black piece of cloth in mid-air to simulate flies. As the frogs jumped and swallowed the cloth, they were quickly placed in reed containers or sacks to be dressed later with ash to remove their slime. Betute, as the same sounds, is a pun for betute (pufferfish), a term used to stuffed with a sausage meat or mincemeat. This actually ushered the start of Kapampangan Frog Tradition.</p>

        One of the strengths of Kapampangan people is cooking. Pampanga is known as the Culinary Capital of the Philippines. One of the well-known dish in Pampanga is Sisig, usually is made from parts of pig head and chicken liver, it is seasoned with calamansi or lime, onions and chili peppers. Angeles City's Sisig Fiesta will feature the Philippines' best pork dish. SISIG, named the “arguably greatest pork dish on earth” by the New York Times, debuted last April and April 28, 2018 at the Train Station ‘Crossing' in Angeles City.
        Kapampangan loves celebrations. They have a lot of festivals like Hot Air Balloon competitions, aircraft maneuvers and precision flying, ultralights, RC Demonstration Flying, sky diving, aircraft rally, rocketeering, flag hop, balloon bursting competition, kite flying, trade fair, carnival rides, and nightly concerts are all part of the annual festival. Thousands of visitors come to the site to see the early morning and late afternoon balloon fly-outs, which include foreign hot-air balloons from all over the world. 
        Another is the Giant Lantern Festival held every December of the year, the star lantern parol is perhaps the most iconic Filipino Christmas emblem – bright, lovingly made, and brimming with the spirit of the season. The Christmas lantern, or Parul Sampernandu in Kapampangan, is inextricably linked to the city that gave birth to it, San Fernando. San Fernando is well-known for it. It is this that has made the city popular throughout the region, if not the entire world. And San Fernando has earned for itself the title of “Christmas Capital of the Philippines.” 
        And lastly, there were hundreds of visitors watched in disbelief as actors disguised as Roman soldiers pounded four-inch nails into a Filipino's hands and feet into a wooden cross for the 33rd time in a Good Friday crucifixion re-enactment. Kapampangan’s are known to be deeply religious. Most are devout Catholics, thus they take their religiosity to the extreme sometimes. One of such actions happens in the City of San Fernando Pampanga, Barangay San Pedro Cutud.
        The San Pedro Cutud Lenten Rites is a Holy Week (Good Friday) re-enactment of Christ’s Passion and Death where it includes a passion play where at least three penitents are nailed to wooden crosses atop a makeshift Calvary though this practice is not recommended by religious leaders in the country the is still attended routinely by many Catholics all over the world.
         Year after year, visitors flock to the province of Pampanga, north of the capital, to see the gruesome show of devotion, which is frowned upon by the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines. Barefoot penitents often whip themselves as a form of penance.

    <h1>Kapampangan Language</h1>
    <p>Kapampangan, also called Pampango, is ethnolinguistic group living in the Philippines, principally in the central plain of Luzon, especially in the province of Pampanga, but also in parts of other adjoining provinces. Kapampangans numbered some two million in the early 21st century.

    The Kapampangan language is closely related to others of the central Philippines which belongs to the Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) family of languages. The Kapampangan homeland, which used to extend north from Manila Bay, has a relatively high population density. Many Kapampangans are tenant farmers and landless workers. Artists of the group are mostly potters, jewelers, lantern makers, blacksmiths, and wood-carvers. Most Kapampangans are Christians, predominantly Roman Catholics.</p>

          <h2 class="loc"><strong>Parul and the Giant San Fernando Lantern</strong> <br/></h2>
          <p class="desc">Kapampangan’s have been creating all kinds of arts and crafts with their hands for the purposes of utilitarian and decorative functions (homes, word, leisure and religion).
          To name a few: Kuran at Pasu (Sto. Tomas), Gitara (Guagua), Burarul (Angeles), etc.
          San Fernando is known for their “Parul”. The industry owes its popularity to them who pioneered the evolution of this paper / wooden star lanterns for the “lubenes” (procession) to the giant kaleidoscopic lanterns which are present every December’s Giant Lantern Festival.
          Electricity gave rise to more innovation. One prolific figure is Rodolfo David whom used rotors to give the lanterns their amazing play of colors.

          <p class="desc">Kapampangan’s are known to be deeply religious. Most are devout Catholics, thus they take their religiosity to the extreme sometimes. One of such actions happens in the City of San Fernando Pampanga, Barangay San Pedro Cutud.
          The San Pedro Cutud Lenten Rites is a Holy Week (Good Friday) re-enactment of Christ’s Passion and Death where it includes a passion play where at least three penitents are nailed to wooden crosses atop a makeshift Calvary though this practice is not recommended by religious leaders in the country the is still attended routinely by many Catholics all over the world.

          <h2 class="loc"><strong>Creation Myth from Kapampangans</strong> <br/></h2>
          <p class="desc">A long, long time ago, the universe was full of gods and goddesses. Of all these gods there existed one supreme god by the name of Mangechay. He ruled the universe for several millenniums with great power.

            These gods lived in the different planets, and their common temple was suspended in the air. These planets were far apart. It took hundreds of years to go from one planet to another.
            
            The great god who ruled over them lived in the sun and his bride lived in the moon. Their daughter lived in a planet called after her name (presumably Venus).
            
            The supreme god sent for all his vassals to meet in great council to decide on a certain affair in the universe. The gods responded to the call and the elements were disturbed greatly by the swiftness of their chariots.
            
            As soon as they gazed at the beautiful daughter of Mangechay who was seated on her golden chair the gods were charmed at her beauty. Instead of deciding on the affair of the universe, the gods proposed marriage to the pretty goddess.
            
            The great god was troubled and did not know on whom he should confer the hand of his daughter. Finally he decided that the question was to be settled by combat. The gods returned to their respective abodes and made the necessary preparations.
            
            The encounter lasted for several thousand years and nearly all the gods perished. During the battle the daughter of Mangechay died and consequently the trouble ended. The great god, after the combat, looked down and saw the earth of today to his great surprise. The earth was formed by the great masses of stones used in the fight.
